JavaScript Arrays and Strings


1. Exploring Array Manipulation in JavaScript


Objective: 
The aim of this assignment is to familiarize students with various array manipulation techniques in JavaScript, including adding and removing elements, 
transforming arrays, and applying array methods.


Problem Statement: 
You are tasked with creating a JavaScript program that demonstrates different array manipulation operations. The program should cover adding and 
removing elements, sorting arrays, applying array methods such as map, filter, and reduce, and exploring the spread and rest operators.


Task 1: Adding and Removing Elements
- Create an array containing some initial elements.
- Use the push method to add a new element to the end of the array.
- Use the pop method to remove the last element from the array.
status: COMPLETE

Task 2: Sorting Arrays
- Create an array of numbers in random order.
- Use the sort method to sort the array in ascending order.
status: COMPLETE

Task 3: Applying Array Methods
- Create an array of numbers.
- Use the map method to double each number in the array.
- Use the filter method to filter out even numbers from the array.
- Use the reduce method to calculate the sum of all numbers in the array.
status: COMPLETE


2. Exploring String Manipulation in JavaScript
Objective: The aim of this assignment is to acquaint students with various string manipulation techniques in JavaScript, including string length, case conversion, 
substring extraction, and string splitting.


Problem Statement: 
You are tasked with creating a JavaScript program that demonstrates different string manipulation operations. The program should cover obtaining the length of a string, 
converting cases (upper and lower), extracting substrings, and splitting strings based on a delimiter.


Task 1: Obtaining String Length - Create a string with some text content. - Use the `length` property to obtain the length of the string.
status: COMPLETE

Task 2: Converting Cases - Create a string with mixed-case content. - Use the `toUpperCase` method to convert the string to uppercase. - Use the `toLowerCase` method to 
convert the string to lowercase.
status: COMPLETE

Task 3: Extracting Substrings - Create a string with some text content. - Use the `substring` method to extract a substring from the original string.
status: COMPLETE

Task 4: Splitting Strings - Create a string containing multiple words separated by spaces. - Use the `split` method to split the string into an array of words based on 
the space delimiter.
status: COMPLETE
