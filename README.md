# **Hello, World!**


The files in this repository are used for my assignment for JavaScript Arrays and Strings, Module 10 Lesson 3.


Overview:

For this assignment I created an HTML document and linked it to 2 JavaScript files. The HTML document is to allow access to the console for verification of results. The 
2 JavaScript files contain the code completing each task under each section, 1 JavaScript file was created for each section. Below is a list of files and their 
descriptions. All code is notated to indicate what is being done, and the code is broken up into sections according to task number.
